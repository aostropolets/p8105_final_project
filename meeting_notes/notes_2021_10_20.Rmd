* Brainstorm research questions and potential datasets

Research Questions
-How do centers vary by geography (offer acceptance ratios, who gets added/death while on waitlist, )?
-Have centers changed their practices (offer acceptance ratios, who gets added to waitlist, ) over time?
-Which centers are associated with higher/riskier offer acceptance ratios?

Data source: https://www.srtr.org/reports/program-specific-reports/

** Kidney transplants
-- which centers have patients like me
-- historical data; assess change over time
-- offer acceptance ratios compared across nation
   -- association btwn willingness to accept high-risk pts and time to transplant
      -- kidney donor risk index
      -- donor creatinine
      -- hep C status

* Identify team workflow and organization of resources
* Discuss git branching
* Set goals, member tasks, and timeline

**Team registration and proposal**
First, you will define your teams and propose a project. This proposal should be a **half-page to a page in length** and include:

* The group members (names and UNIs)
* The tentative project title
* The motivation for this project
* The intended final products
* The anticipated data sources
* The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
* The planned timeline

There should be one proposal per group, written collaboratively using .Rmd (rendering to a GH document) in a dedicated GitHub repo. Conceptually, this is intended to review a project that is 10% complete.

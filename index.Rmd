Welcome to the [Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients](https://www.srtr.org/) (SRTR) Dashboard and Repository. Our site compiles and presents national registry data on all organ donors, transplant candidates, and transplant recipients in the United States based on biannual [Program-Specific Reports](https://www.srtr.org/reports/program-specific-reports/) from the SRTR. Our site utilizes center-level data on waitlisted patients and patients in receipt of transplants, aggregated demographics, transplant outcomes, and organ offer acceptance practices.   

The [**SRTR Dashboard**](dashboard.html) presents data visualizations comparing kidney transplantation centers and examining organ offer practices over time. Typically this data is only presented at the site level in PSR. We combined reports for each site and present them in an aggregated format to allow for direct comparison.   

The [**SRTR Data Repository**](data_repository.html) provides users with the ability to search and copy, print, or download raw SRTR data for further study. Users may filter by a single column or query all columns simultaneously using the search bar.

This site was created as part of a final project for the [P8105 Data Science](https://www.p8105.com/) course taught in the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/).
